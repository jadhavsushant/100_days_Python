# Python-100-Days-Boot_Camp

### This is my personal note made public ###

<br /> In 2022, I want to be a Pythonist. As well as learning Python, I am working hard in my company.
<br /> My personal goal is to complete 100 days of boot camp by July 2022.
<br /> On the learning ability, I am sure it will be complete before that.
